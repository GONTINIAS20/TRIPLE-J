		<p class="JAPANTRIP">My first career is to become a successful in business that I need to be organized. Organization will help me complete tasks and stay on top of things to be done. That's a good way to do this and to create a to-do list each day. As I complete each item, check it off your list. This will ensure that I'm not forgetting anything and I'm completing all the tasks that are essential to the survival of my business.
